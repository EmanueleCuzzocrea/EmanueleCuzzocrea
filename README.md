Hi, I'm Emanuele 👋 I am currently a PhD student in Robotics and Intelligent Machines at the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Genoa, within the Humanoid & Human Centered Mechatronics (HHCM) Lab, under the supervision of Dr. Nikolaos Tsagarakis. My research focuses on the application of foundation models to legged robotics, with particular emphasis on loco-manipulation and navigation tasks.

During my Master’s studies, I conducted research at the PRISMA Lab, where I contributed to the hardware construction of the SOLO 12 quadruped robot and carried out my thesis, titled “Studying Locomotion Gaits for Quadruped Robots in Push-and-Slide Tasks”, supervised by Prof. Fabio Ruggiero.

My research interests include legged robotics, loco-manipulation, navigation and AI. Outside of robotics, I enjoy speedcubing, tennis, golf, chess, drawing, and video game development.
